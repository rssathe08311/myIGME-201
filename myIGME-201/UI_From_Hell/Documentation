THEME
	For this question, I decided that the form would be the work of an all-powerful trickster who has decided to make people go through their process to cause chaos 
		for the sake of it.
FUNCTION
	FORM 1 - Start Page
		When you open the page you will see two buttons, a start button and an exit button. If you click on the exit button it will not allow you to leave and display
		a message. If you press the start button it will create many images and show the real start button. Clicking this actual start button will then load the main form
	FORM 2 - Main Form
		When it loads the only visible thing will be a 'Hello' button that when the user clicks disappears and shows the rest of the form. A textbox with a name prompt and a 
		checkbox. Once you have entered a name and clicked the checkbox, a message will pop up. There is also a timer that is running and once it runs out the application closes.
		The first radio button will trap you in a loop of just the start button and the full interface until you click another radio button. The curiosity button will cause
		a bunch of question marks to appear all over the form. The defeat button will show the user a message and then close the application. The work button will open up form 3
		a job application form.
	FORM 3 - Job Application Form
		This form has a textbox that asks the user to fill out why they should be hired for the position. Then a groupBox with radio buttons that asks if you expect to be paid
		if you say yes the form laughs at you and exits the application. If you say no it rejects you and closes the application.
The form can be stopped by clicking the X button in the top right corner.
